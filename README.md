[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ibm-functions/template-cloud-object-storage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ibm-functions/template-cloud-object-storage)

### Overview
You can use the Cloud Object Storage template to deploy IBM Cloud Functions assets for you. The assets created by this template are described in the `manifest.yaml` file, which can be found at `template-cloud-object-storage/runtimes/nodejs/manifest.yaml`.

The Cloud Object Storage template creates a form where users can upload a photo into a Cloud Object Storage bucket. The template deploys a Web Action, *initialHtml*, that contains an html form, which passes its data to the *handleForm* Action. When the form data is parsed by the *handleForm* Action, the image uploaded in the form is stored in the Cloud Object Storage instance. Since this is a public Web action, be aware that *any* user can post photos into your bucket. For added security, you can [secure](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/openwhisk/openwhisk_webactions.html#securing-web-actions) the Web action.

### Prerequisites
The template expects to find a `cloud-object-storage` package that contains a *client-get-signed-url* and a *bucket-cors-put* function. You can download and deploy the `cloud-object-storage` package from [here](https://github.com/ibm-functions/package-cloud-object-storage).

Use the `wskdeploy` utility to deploy the template and package. In the future, `wskdeploy` will be integrated into a new `wsk` plug-in command `bx wsk deploy`.

For now, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-wskdeploy/releases), and add `wskdeploy` to your PATH.

### Deploying the Template
After the `cloud-object-storage` package is deployed, use the `wskdeploy` tool to deploy the assets described in the `manifest.yaml` file. The `PACKAGE_NAME` value can be changed to your own package name. The BUCKET is the bucket in your COS instance you want the template to use.
```
pushd runtimes/nodejs/
PACKAGE_NAME=upload-a-photo BUCKET=myBucket wskdeploy
popd
```
Once the template is deployed, you can find the web address of the simple app by first going to the [Actions](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/actions) page, selecting your action, and then clicking **Endpoints**.
Under the **Endpoints** tab you will find a web action section with a link. Copy this link without the .json suffix, and paste it into your browser's address bar.

You should now see a simple app for updating a user's profile picture. Go check out the application code to see how everything is working together, and expand this into your own app!

### Available Languages
The `cloud-object-storage` template is available in Node.js.
